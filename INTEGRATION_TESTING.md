# Multiplayer Lobby Integration Testing Guide

This guide explains how to test the multiplayer lobby system that's now integrated into the game's graphical interface.

## What Has Been Integrated

✅ **Direct Network Connection**: The LobbyView now connects directly to the working server  
✅ **Graphical Lobby Interface**: Full UI for creating, joining, and managing lobbies  
✅ **Real-time Chat**: In-lobby communication between players  
✅ **Nickname Selection**: Players choose nicknames before joining  
✅ **No Gradle Dependency**: Uses pure Java networking  

## Prerequisites

1. **Working Server**: The `SimpleMultiplayerServer` must be running
2. **Java Environment**: Java 8+ installed and in PATH
3. **Game Assets**: The game's asset files must be accessible

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Start the Server
```bash
# Double-click this file:
start_simple_server.bat
```

You should see:
```
Simple Multiplayer server started on port 8080
Ready to accept connections...
```

### Step 2: Test Basic Integration
```bash
# Double-click this file to verify server connection:
test_integration.bat
```

This will test:
- Server connectivity
- Basic command handling
- Lobby list requests
- Echo functionality

### Step 3: Test the Full Game Lobby

#### Option A: If Gradle Works
1. Build the project: `./gradlew build`
2. Launch the game
3. Navigate to Multiplayer
4. Enter a nickname
5. Test lobby features

#### Option B: If Gradle Has Issues
1. The networking code is already integrated
2. The LobbyView will connect to the server
3. You can test the UI and networking separately

## What You Can Test

### Lobby Creation
- Enter lobby name and max players
- Click "Create Lobby"
- Verify lobby appears in the list

### Lobby Joining
- View available lobbies
- Click "Join" on any lobby
- Verify you're added to the lobby

### Chat System
- Type messages in the chat input
- Press Enter or click "Send"
- Verify messages appear for all players

### Lobby Management
- Refresh lobby list
- Leave lobbies
- Navigate back to main menu

## Network Protocol

The integrated system uses the same simple protocol as the test server:

- `CREATE_LOBBY:name:maxPlayers:hostId`
- `JOIN_LOBBY:lobbyId`
- `LEAVE_LOBBY:lobbyId`
- `LOBBY_LIST_REQUEST`
- `CHAT:lobbyId:message`

## Troubleshooting

### Server Connection Issues
- Ensure server is running on port 8080
- Check firewall settings
- Verify no other services use port 8080

### Game Launch Issues
- The networking code is independent of Gradle
- Check if game assets are accessible
- Verify Java version compatibility

### Lobby Functionality Issues
- Check server console for error messages
- Verify client connections in server logs
- Test with the simple test client first

## Files Modified

- `core/src/main/java/com/StardewValley/View/LobbyView.java` - Integrated networking
- `core/src/main/java/com/StardewValley/controllers/LobbyController.java` - Simplified controller
- `SimpleGameLauncher.java` - Integration test launcher
- `test_integration.bat` - Integration test script

## Technical Details

### Network Implementation
- **Direct Socket Connection**: Uses `java.net.Socket` directly
- **Text-based Protocol**: Simple colon-separated messages
- **Asynchronous Message Handling**: Background thread for server messages
- **UI Thread Safety**: Uses `Gdx.app.postRunnable()` for UI updates

### Integration Points
- **Nickname Selection**: Dialog appears before server connection
- **Automatic Connection**: Connects to server after nickname selection
- **Real-time Updates**: Lobby list and chat update automatically
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback for connection issues

## Next Steps

Once the integration is verified:

1. **Test Multiple Players**: Launch multiple game instances
2. **Verify Chat Functionality**: Test real-time messaging
3. **Test Lobby Management**: Create, join, and leave lobbies
4. **Performance Testing**: Test with multiple concurrent players

## Success Criteria

The integration is successful when:
- ✅ Game launches and shows lobby interface
- ✅ Nickname dialog appears and works
- ✅ Server connection is established
- ✅ Lobby creation works
- ✅ Lobby joining works
- ✅ Chat functionality works
- ✅ Multiple players can connect simultaneously

This integration provides a working multiplayer lobby system that's independent of the complex build system, allowing you to test and use multiplayer functionality immediately.
