# Multiplayer Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up and use the multiplayer lobby system for the Stardew Valley game.

## Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher
- Gradle build system
- The game project compiled

## Starting the Multiplayer Server

1. **Build the project first:**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

2. **Start the multiplayer server:**
   - On Windows: Double-click `start_multiplayer_server.bat`
   - On Linux/Mac: Run `java -cp "core/build/classes/java/main:core/build/resources/main:lwjgl3/build/classes/java/main:lwjgl3/build/resources/main" com.StardewValley.network.MultiplayerGameServer`

3. **Server will start on port 8080** - you should see:
   ```
   Multiplayer server started on port 8080
   ```

## Using the Multiplayer System

### 1. Launch the Game
- Start the game normally
- Click "Login as Guest" or login with your account
- Select "Multiplayer" from the game mode selection

### 2. Nickname Selection
- A dialog will appear asking you to choose a nickname
- Enter your desired nickname
- Click "Confirm" to proceed

### 3. Lobby Features
Once connected to the server, you can:

- **Create a Lobby:**
  - Enter a lobby name
  - Set maximum players (default: 4)

- **Player Synchronization:** Real-time position updates (for future game integration)
- **Connection Management:** Automatic handling of player connections/disconnections

## Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start
- Ensure Java is installed and in your PATH
- Check that port 8080 is not already in use
- Verify the project has been built successfully

### Can't Connect to Server
- Ensure the server is running
- Check that the client is configured to connect to `localhost:8080`
- Verify firewall settings allow connections on port 8080

### Lobby Issues
- Refresh the lobby list if lobbies don't appear
- Ensure you have a valid nickname selected
- Check server console for error messages
