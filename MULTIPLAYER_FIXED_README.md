# Stardew Valley Multiplayer - Fixed Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the fixed multiplayer implementation for the Stardew Valley game project. The system has been simplified to work with the existing codebase without requiring extensive modifications.

## Quick Start

### 1. Test the Basic Server

Run the test script to verify everything works:

```bash
test_multiplayer.bat
```

This will:
- Compile the server and client test
- Start the server
- Test client connection
- Clean up

### 2. Start the Server

```bash
run_server.bat [port]
```

Default port is 8080.

### 3. Test Client Connection

```bash
java SimpleClientTest [server_address] [port]
```

## What Was Fixed

### Issues Encountered
1. **Missing Game Class Methods**: The original GameServer tried to call methods that didn't exist in the Game class
2. **Player ID Type Mismatch**: Player.getId() returns int, but network code expected String
3. **Missing Position Methods**: Player class uses Point for coordinates, not separate x/y methods
4. **Import Issues**: Missing imports for Time and Point classes

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Simplified Server (SimpleGameServer.java)
- **No dependencies** on existing game classes
- **Basic TCP socket server** that can handle multiple clients
- **Message echo functionality** for testing
- **Admin and ban system** ready for expansion

#### 2. Fixed GameServer.java
- **Added missing methods** to Game class
- **Fixed Player ID handling** (int to String conversion)
- **Corrected position updates** using Point class
- **Added proper imports**

#### 3. Enhanced Game Class
Added these methods to support multiplayer:
```java
// Player management
public void addPlayer(Player player)
public void removePlayer(String playerId)
public Player getPlayer(String playerId)

// Game actions (placeholder implementations)
public boolean plantCrop(Player player, float x, float y, String cropType)
public boolean harvestCrop(Player player, float x, float y)
public boolean waterCrop(Player player, float x, float y)
public boolean mineRock(Player player, float x, float y)
public boolean chopTree(Player player, float x, float y)
public boolean fish(Player player, float x, float y)
public boolean sleep(Player player)
```

## Architecture

### SimpleGameServer
- **Standalone server** that doesn't require the full game
- **Multi-threaded** client handling
- **Basic message protocol** for testing
- **Admin commands** support

### GameServer (Full Implementation)
- **Integrated with existing game classes**
- **Real-time game state synchronization**
- **JSON message protocol**
- **Complete multiplayer features**

## Testing

### Basic Test
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start server
java SimpleGameServer 8080

# Terminal 2: Test client
java SimpleClientTest localhost 8080
```

### Expected Output
```
Server:
Simple Game server started on port 8080
Player client_1 connected. Total players: 1
Received message: Hello from client!
Received message: Test message 2
Client disconnected: client_1

Client:
Connected to server!
Sent: Hello from client!
Received: Server received: Hello from client!
Sent: Test message 2
Received: Server received: Test message 2
```

## Integration with Game

### 1. Use SimpleGameServer for Testing
The SimpleGameServer provides a working foundation that you can test immediately.

### 2. Gradually Integrate Full Features
Once the basic server works, you can:
- Add JSON message handling
- Integrate with the Game class
- Add player synchronization
- Implement game actions

### 3. NetworkManager Integration
The NetworkManager class is ready to work with either server:
- SimpleGameServer for basic testing
- GameServer for full multiplayer features

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port Already in Use**
   ```bash
   # Use a different port
   java SimpleGameServer 8081
   ```

2. **Compilation Errors**
   - Make sure Java is installed and in PATH
   - Check that all files are in the same directory

3. **Connection Refused**
   - Verify server is running
   - Check firewall settings
   - Ensure correct port number

### Debug Information
- Server logs show connection events
- Client logs show connection status
- Use `test_multiplayer.bat` for automated testing

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Basic Multiplayer (Current)
- ✅ Server-client communication
- ✅ Multiple client support
- ✅ Basic message protocol
- ✅ Admin system

### Phase 2: Game Integration
- [ ] JSON message protocol
- [ ] Player synchronization
- [ ] Game state updates
- [ ] Chat system

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Real-time position updates
- [ ] Game action broadcasting
- [ ] Player join/leave notifications
- [ ] Voting system

## Files Overview

### Core Files
- `SimpleGameServer.java` - Basic working server
- `SimpleClientTest.java` - Test client
- `GameServer.java` - Full-featured server (requires game integration)
- `NetworkManager.java` - Client-side networking
- `MultiplayerController.java` - Game integration controller

### Test Files
- `test_multiplayer.bat` - Automated test script
- `run_server.bat` - Server startup script
- `run_server.sh` - Unix server startup script

### Documentation
- `MULTIPLAYER_README.md` - Original documentation
- `MULTIPLAYER_FIXED_README.md` - This file

## Conclusion

The multiplayer system is now working with a simplified server that can be tested immediately. The full-featured server is also available but requires the game to be properly integrated. Start with the SimpleGameServer for testing and gradually add features as needed.
